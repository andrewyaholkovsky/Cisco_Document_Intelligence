# Document Intelligence Project
### Northwestern MLDS (Machine Learning and Data Science) Team

## Project Overview

The Document Intelligence project aims to automate the extraction of key attributes from Cisco supplier data product specifications which are predominantly in an unstructured format. The existing process of attribute extraction is manual and time-consuming. By leveraging advanced AI techniques, our initiative strives to significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of data extraction and processing. The outcome of this project will serve as a robust foundation for developing a general-purpose framework tailored for document intelligence.

## Core Topics Explored

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Generative AI

## Data Collection

- Supplier Data (Product Specifications)
- Data Sheets containing attributes

## Technology Stack

- Python
- Tensorflow/Keras
- OpenCV
- spaCy or other NLP Libraries

## Team Members

- Andrew Yaholkovsky
- Sam Swain
- Xin Shu
- Xingyu Wang
- Yiqing Cheng
- Ziqiao Ao
